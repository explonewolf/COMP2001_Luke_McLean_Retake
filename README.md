COMP2001 - Luke Mclean

to run this, 
WebApplication1\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1/Webapplication1
go to [localHost 5000 or 5001] (https://localhost:5001/) 
enter details any that pass the auth api will work ( when testing make sure to use wrong attempts first as login system uses cookies so will keep you signed in) 
when signed in go to https://localhost:5001/index.html which will bring you to the main swagger page. ( you can only use this when you have signed in otherwise you will be held at /login)
